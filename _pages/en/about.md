For the past 4 years, I have worked in web development and database management as the sole technician at the Maude Abbott Medical Museum in Montréal, QC Canada. 

I took the lead in designing and deploying an Oracle APEX application that is used to manage the museum's extensive repository of 10,000+ digitized artifacts. The system serves not only to support the documentation and curation of the collection, but also significantly streamlines administrative and research workflows by offering robust and efficient data processing.

I also maintain the [museum website](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicalmuseum/) using a LAMP stack, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience for a global audience of researchers and visitors. My work ensures the museum's online presence reflects the richness and professionalism of its collection for ~2000 unique visitors each month.

Beyond my technical contributions, I oversaw a transformative, long-term expansion project in 2022 that doubled the museum's physical footprint and introduced two new, high-traffic exhibits. This project also included planning the renovation of the expanded space to ensure the best practices for storing over 1,000 new artifacts acquired from Université Laval.

My passion lies in creating efficient, user-centered applications that empower users and drive institutional growth. I am especially drawn to opportunities where technology can support research, education, and innovation in fields like biomedical science. I am excited to contribute my technical expertise and project management experience to a professional team in developing innovative, integrated technologies that make a meaningful impact.
