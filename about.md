For the past 4 years, I have worked in web development and database management as the sole technician at the Maude Abbott Medical Museum in Montréal, QC Canada. 

I took the lead in designing and deploying an Oracle APEX application that is used to manage the museum's extensive repository of 10,000+ digitized artifacts. The system serves not only to support the documentation and curation of the collection, but also significantly streamlines administrative and research workflows by offering robust and efficient data processing.

I also maintain the [museum website](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicalmuseum/) using a LAMP stack, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience for a global audience of visitors and researchers. My work ensures the museum's online presence reflects the richness and professionalism of its collection.

Beyond my technical contributions, I oversaw a transformative, long-term expansion project that doubled the museum's physical footprint and introduced two new, high-traffic exhibits. This project also involved planning the renovation of the expansion to ensure best practices in the storage of over 1,000 new artifacts following an acquisition of collections from Université Laval.

My passion lies in creating efficient, user-centered applications that empower users and drive institutional growth. I am especially drawn to opportunities where technology can support research, education, and innovation in fields like biomedical science. I am excited to contribute my technical expertise and project management experience to a professional team in developing innovative, integrated technologies that make a meaningful impact.
