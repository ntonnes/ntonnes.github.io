Welcome to my website! For the past 4 years, I have worked in web development and database management as the sole technician at the Maude Abbott Medical Museum in Montréal, QC Canada.

I am responsible for the design and deployment of the Oracle APEX application that supports the extensive database of 10,000+ digitized artifacts and streamlines administrative workflows at the museum.

I also maintain the [museum website](https://www.mcgill.ca/medicalmuseum/) using a LAMP stack, ensuring a seamless user experience for visitors and researchers.

In addition to maintaining the digital infrastructure of the museum, I also oversaw a long-term expansion project at the museum, which doubled it's physical space and added two new exhibits. This project coincided with an acquisition of over 1,000 new artifacts following the downsizing of a museum at Université Laval.

My passion ultimately lies in delivering efficient, user-centered applications, particularly in the biomedical industry where technology supports research and education. I look forward to working on software as part of a team, leveraging my experience in project management to develop innovative, integrated technologies that empower users.
